# ARCUV (Autonomous Robot Car based on Ultrasonic and Visual sensors)

## Description

This is the final project for **CSIE5047 Robotics** in National Taiwan University.  
This repository contains the python codes that we implemented for our **small-scale self-constructed autonomous car.**  


## Goal
Our goal was to make a small-scale autonomous car from scratch. With `ultrasonic and visual sensor` equipped, the car was able to operate safely in our self-constructed city.  
  
Below are some functionalities that we implemented:

- Basic control
- Lane detection  
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Traffic light recognition
